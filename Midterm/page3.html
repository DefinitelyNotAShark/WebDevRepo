        <h1>The Jumblies</h1>
<p>
They went to sea in a Sieve, they did,<br>
   In a Sieve they went to sea:<br>
In spite of all their friends could say,<br>
On a winter's morn, on a stormy day,<br>
   In a Sieve they went to sea!<br>
And when the Sieve turned round and round,<br>
And every one cried, "You'll all be drowned!"<br>
They called aloud, "Our Sieve ain't big,<br>
But we don't care a button! we don't care a fig!<br>
   In a Sieve we'll go to sea!"<br>
      Far and few, far and few,<br>
         Are the lands where the Jumblies live;<br>
      Their heads are green, and their hands are blue,<br>
         And they went to sea in a Sieve.<br>
</p>
        <p>
They sailed in a Sieve, they did,<br>
   In a Sieve they sailed so fast,<br>
With only a beautiful pea-green veil<br>
Tied with a ribbon by way of a sail,<br>
   To a small tobacco-pipe mast;<br>
<br>And every one said, who saw them go,"<br>
0 won't they be soon upset, you know!<br>
For the sky is dark, and the voyage is long,<br>
And happen what may, it's extremely wrong<br>
   In a Sieve to sail so fast!"<br>
      Far and few, far and few,<br>
         Are the lands where the Jumblies live;<br>
      Their heads are green, and their hands are blue,<br>
         And they went to sea in a Sieve.<br>
        </p>
<p>
The water it soon came in, it did,<br>
   The water it soon came in;<br>
So to keep them dry, they wrapped their feet<br>
In a pinky paper all folded neat,<br>
   And they fastened it down with a pin.<br>
And they passed the night in a crockery-jar,<br>
And each of them said, "How wise we are!<br><br>
Though the sky be dark, and the voyage be long,<br>
Yet we never can think we were rash or wrong,<br>
   While round in our Sieve we spin!"<br>
      Far and few, far and few,<br>
         Are the lands where the Jumblies live;<br>
      Their heads are green, and their hands are blue,<br>
         And they went to sea in a Sieve.<br>
        </p>
<p>
And all night long they sailed away;<br>
   And when the sun went down,<br>
They whistled and warbled a moony song<br>
To the echoing sound of a coppery gong,<br>
   In the shade of the mountains brown.<br>
"0 Timballo! How happy we are,<br>
When we live in a sieve and a crockery-jar,<br>
And all night long in the moonlight pale,<br>
We sail away with a pea-green sail,<br>
   In the shade of the mountains brown!"<br>
      Far and few, far and few,<br>
         Are the lands where the Jumblies live;<br>
      Their heads are green, and their hands are blue,<br>
         And they went to sea in a Sieve.<br>
        </p>
<p>
They sailed to the Western Sea, they did,<br>
   To a land all covered with trees,<br>
And they bought an Owl, and a useful Cart,<br>
And a pound of Rice, and a Cranberry Tart,<br>
   And a hive of silvery Bees.<br>
And they bought a Pig, and some green Jack-daws,<br>
And a lovely Monkey with lollipop paws,<br>
And forty bottles of Ring-Bo-Ree,<br>
   And no end of Stilton Cheese.<br>
      Far and few, far and few,<br>
         Are the lands where the Jumblies live;<br>
      Their heads are green, and their hands are blue,<br>
         And they went to sea in a Sieve.<br>
        </p>
<p>
And in twenty years they all came back,<br>
   In twenty years or more,<br>
And every one said, "How tall they've grown!<br>
For they've been to the Lakes, and the Torrible Zone,<br>
   And the hills of the Chankly Bore";<br>
And they drank their health, and gave them a feast<br>
Of dumplings made of beautiful yeast;<br>
And every one said, "If we only live,<br>
We too will go to sea in a Sieve,--<br>
   To the hills of the Chankly Bore!"<br>
      Far and few, far and few,<br>
         Are the lands where the Jumblies live;<br>
      Their heads are green, and their hands are blue,<br>
         And they went to sea in a Sieve.<br>
