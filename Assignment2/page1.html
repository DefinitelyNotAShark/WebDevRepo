  <p>You're travelling to a neighboring town, but have hit a fork in the road <br></p>

  <p>It splits into 2 paths. Looks like one continues on deeper in the forest. <br>
  it's very dark down that way and you can't see very far. You'd probably get there sooner though.</p>

  <p>The second path twists left in the direction of a nearby river.<br>
  It looks a bit safer but would probably take longer to get to the next town.</p>

  <p>Which way do you go?</p> <!-- The weirdness here is just a bunch of manually entered spaces between the optionz -->
