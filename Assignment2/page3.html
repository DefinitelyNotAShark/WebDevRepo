  <p>You wander down by the river.<br>
  There are many cool rocks down there. You try to collect as many as you can.<br></p>

  <p>All the rocks are very heavy, but you keep collecting them.<br>
  You can't bring yourself to put any of them down. They're so heavy.</p>

  <p>The rocks are so heavy that you can't walk anymore.<br>
  You don't know if you'll ever make it to town, but you have a bunch of sweet rocks now. <br>
  Everything is fine.</p>

  <p>The End</p>
